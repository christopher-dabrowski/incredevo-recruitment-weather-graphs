# IncreDevo recruitment task - Log API calls

This is my attempt at solving the second recruitment task for the [IncreDevo company](https://incredevo.com/)

## Task description

## Solution

Description of my solution to the presented problem.

### Architecture

<!-- ![Architecture diagram](docs/Architecture.drawio.png) -->

#### IoC

<!-- I've used [Bicep](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview) to define IoC. The IoC approach allows me to have documented and consistent infrastructure.
I've chosen Bicep technology as it's easy to run from any environment that has access to Azure.

The Bicep code can be found in the [infrastructure](infrastructure) directory.

The Bicep resource and module dependencies diagram looks as follows:

### Time tracking

For time tracking I'm using [Clockify](https://clockify.me/) and I'm tracking time for each task using GitHub issues.  
I'll add the final time report when I finish the task.

### CI/CD

<!-- To implement an automated deployment process I've used GitHub Actions.  
Specific actions are triggered when changes are pushed to a specific repository path or can be triggered manually.  
Actions definitions can be found in the [.github/workflows](.github/workflows) directory. -->
